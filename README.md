## Hellooo
My name is Lennard and I am currently writing my master's thesis on optimization-based robot motion planning for dexterous, high-dof robots at the [*TUM-DLR AIDX*](https://aidx-lab.org/) lab led by Prof. BÃ¤uml.

- ðŸ”­ Geometry and optimization problems are right up my alley
- âš¡ Control systems are the best systems, right after sound systems
